## 🚀 SALES POL DASHBOARD

Introducing **SalesPol Dashboard** — a sleek, modern admin dashboard built with **Angular 16.2.0** and powered by **ApexCharts** for rich data visualizations.
- With the pie chart the same component can be used for donut and pie chart all you need to do is charge the type to `donut or pie` and it will be reflected in the component.
- With the bar chart also based on the number of elements parsed in determines whether it should be a single or multiple bar charts and when the `[stacked]=true` is forms a stacked bar chart.
- The table takes in an array of `[tableHeaders]="['Product Name', 'Color', 'Category', 'Price (GHS)']"` is customisable based on your own needs but ensure the data parsed also has the same number of `td` which the table data `rowElements`

### 🧩 Key Features:

* Built with **reusable Angular components** that can be easily invoked and passed dynamic data from parent components.
* Designed with **modularity** in mind — includes a dedicated (but intentionally unused) `dashboard/` directory so developers can integrate the components into their own projects as needed.
* Fully customizable and cleanly structured for real-world analytics and business use cases.
